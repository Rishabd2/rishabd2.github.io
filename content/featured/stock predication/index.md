To accurately predict stock trends, I developed a stock market prediction system using Pandas, NumPy, and LSTM Neural Networks. Applying ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, the system achieved 85% accuracy on historical data. Model accuracy improved by 5% through NLP-based sentiment analysis of financial news.
