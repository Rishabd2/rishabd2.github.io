Objective: Optimized urban and ride-sharing traffic with algorithmic and predictive modeling.

- Performed hexagonal division for mapping origin \& destination onto street network to determine traffic for 8 dock stations
- Analyzed hub location inventory model \& various ride-sharing models deployed at Lyft, Uber \& at New York \& Shanghai
- Used greedy approach algorithm to maximize efficiency in laying of dock stations \& employed heatmaps to track demand
- Forecasted demand in a 16 sq km area using fuzzy logic based on 9 factor model due to the inherent variability in demand
